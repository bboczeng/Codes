Instructions to run code:

Put code file (.mat) at the root folder that contains data subfolders. And click run. They should work automatically. 

Problem 1:

Run the matlab code directly. It should generate the desired plot.

Problem 2:

No code needed.

Problem 3:

Run the matlab code directly. It should generate the desired plot. Change the function f3e to f3a, f3b â€¦ f3d to generate plot for different subproblems. Note I used arrow.m for plotting arrows.

Problem 4:

P4_a.m calculated the gaussian mean and variance estimates for training data of digits for all its 10 classes (0-9). 

P4_b.m calculated class prior probability distribution.

P4_c.m shows a representative plot of covariance matrix for class label=5.

P4_di.m performs gaussian linear discriminant analysis using averages Sigma matrix for all classes. it is using different training sizes and generating learning curves.

P4_dii.m performs gaussian quadratic discriminant analysis using different Sigma matrix for each class. it is using different training sizes and generating learning curves.

P4_div.m using the best classifier for Kaggle test data. Generating labels for Kaggle submission

P4_dv.m using k=6 cross validation on the training data set to find the best alpha in matrix-inversion, for spam classfiers. I have featurize_revise.py to add my new features (the same as my HW1). It is also attached.

P4_dv_kaggle.m using the optimal alpha found above for Kaggle test data. Generating labels for Kaggle submission

Problem 5-7:

No code needed.

Instructions to run code:

Put code file (.mat) at the root folder that contains data files (both spam.mat and YearPredictionMSD.txt). And click run. They should work automatically. 

Problem 1:

Run the matlab code problem1.m directly. It should generate the asked result.
problem1_ext.m is another auxiliary file that is used to check how the loss converges with iteration. It is not relevant to the problem.

Problem 2:

Run the matlab code problem2.m directly. It should generate the desired plot. It might take ~2 min to load data. (which should be in the same folder)

Problem 3:

Run the matlab code Problem3_preprocess.m first to generate all 3 preprocessing matrices.
After that, for each subproblems 1,2,3, run Problem3_ia, or Problem3_ib, or Problem3_ic to 
generate the Loss-iteration curve for the ith subproblem with preprocessing scheme a(standardized), b(log) or c(banalized).

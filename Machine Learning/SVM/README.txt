Instructions to run code:

Put all the code files (.m) at the same root folder that also contains the data folder. 

Problem 1:

Run the Matlab code (problem1.m) directly. It should generate the desired plot.

Problem 2:

Run the Matlab code (problem2.m) directly. It should generate the desired plot.

Problem 3:

(problem3.m)

1) To do cross-validation for optimal C:

Set flag to be 0 (rough tuning of C) or 1 (finer tuning of C, with a smaller tuning range around the optimal C) and Run Matlab code.


2) To do Validation on validation set using the optimal C:

Set flag to be 2 and Run Matlab code.

Problem 4:

Run the code (problem4.m) will do a 6-fold cross-validation within the spam_data.mat. I added and modified some features. The python file has been modified to include new features. The modified python code is included as featurize.py.


Kaggle csv:

Run problem3_kaggle.m and problem4_kaggle.m respectively.
